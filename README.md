# udata-search-service

A search service for udata.
The idea is to have search service separated from the udata MongoDB.
The indexation update is made using real-time messages with Kafka.

See the following architecture schema:
![Udata Search Service architecture schema](docs/udata-search-service-schema.png "Udata Search Service architecture schema")

## Getting started

Start the different services using docker-compose:
```
docker-compose up
```

This will start:
- an elasticsearch
- a kafka broker
- a zookeper
- a kafka consumer
- a search app


Initialize the elasticsearch indices
```
flask init-es
```

You can feed the elasticsearch by publishing messages to Kafka.
Using [udata](https://github.com/opendatateam/udata), when you modify objects,
indexation messages will be sent and will be consumed by the kafka consumer.
If you want to reindex your local mongo base in udata, you can run:
```
udata search index
```

After a reindexation, you'll need to change the alias by using the following command:
```
flask set-alias <index-suffix>
```

You can query the search service with the search service api, ex: http://localhost:5000/api/1/datasets/?q=toilettes%20Ã %20rennes

## Troubleshooting

- If the elasticsearch service exits with an error 137, it is killed due to out of memory error. You should read the following points.
- If you are short on RAM, you can limit heap memory by setting `ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms750m -Xmx750m` as environment variable when starting the elasticsearch service.
- If you are on MAC and still encounter RAM memory issues, you should increase Docker limit memory to 4GB instead of default 2GB.
- If you are on Linux, you may need to double the vm.max_map_count. You can set it with the following command: `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`.
- If you are on Linux, you may encounter permissions issues. You can either create the volume or change the user to the current user using `chown`.
